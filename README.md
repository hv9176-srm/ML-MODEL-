Project Title :
A Simple Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

Overview :
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to building and training a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Date and Learning Notes
Date Learned: 2025-09-21

Concepts Explored:

Neural Network: A computational model inspired by the human brain, used for recognizing patterns in data. It consists of layers of interconnected "neurons."

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's the "engine" that handles the complex computations for training neural networks.

Keras: A high-level API that simplifies building and training neural networks. It acts as a user-friendly "dashboard" on top of TensorFlow.

MNIST Dataset: A classic dataset of 60,000 handwritten digits (0-9). It's a great starting point for learning about image classification.

Code Breakdown
The provided code uses the following libraries and components:

tensorflow as tf: Imports the core TensorFlow library.

tensorflow.keras.datasets: Contains functions to download and load common datasets like MNIST.

tensorflow.keras.layers: Provides the building blocks for the neural network, such as Conv2D (convolutional layer) and Dense (fully connected layer).

tensorflow.keras.models: Used to create the network structure, often a Sequential model where layers are stacked one after another.

matplotlib.pyplot as plt: A library for data visualization, used here to display images from the dataset.

This code builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is particularly effective for image-based tasks like digit recognition.
